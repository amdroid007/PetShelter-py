# PetShelter-py
 
Implementation of the PetShelter example application in Python
Fully object-oriented - may require Python 3+ to run

I am by no means a Python developer, and Python is not a pure
Object-oriented language with no support for proper encapsulation,
abstract classes and methods, interface, etc. But it does support
classes, inheritance and polymorphism, and we mostly focus on
those ideas, so Python works fine.

I have tried to demonstrate how a pure Object-Oriented design
will look like in Python, although realize that with no support
for encapsulation, it is just meant to "look like" an OO model.
